# RandomNumberGenerator
This is a random number generator in where python tells the user if theyre close to the number by giving the user hints. The program will have a number, and tell the user whether they are guessing too high of a number, or too low of a number. Then once guessed correctly, the program will then tally up the amount of attempts the user has tried to guess the number.
